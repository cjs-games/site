# site
CJ's Games website source code. Site can be found here: https://cjsgames.github.io/site/

# Setup 
If you want to setup the site for yourself, figure it out yourself. We have way too many people trying to make their own game site since we made the [legacy site](https://sites.google.com/henry.k12.ga.us/cjsgames/home). This is simply to combat others trying to copy us.
